ToDO by the next meeting 22.09.21:


    Obtain a data file from your local system using any tool on your own choice with the structure similar 
    (not equal!) to the one shown in lecture presentation. 
    
    The data can be in any format suitable for furtehr data analysis (ex:  dat; csv, JSON etc).  --- OK
    
    Think of how to clean the data (make the rough data suitable for further analysis   --- NOK
    
    Prepare (R, Python, and/or BASH) code templates to analyze the data. --- OK
    P.S: You can also apply other programming languages that are suitable for data science.
    
    
    Store your code in Github repository
            Don't forget to comment your code --- NOK
            Describe the process in README file  --- NOK
            * Train yourself in submitting materials to Github  through CLI (not just uploading via GUI) 
            with the relevant commit messags on what has been done  --- OK
            
            
    Prepare a short presentation (3-5 slides at max) on the progress and obtained results 
    to be presented during the next meetup. --- NOK



Organizing your work:

    If you already have a repository, just create a new branch and work there (make sure you have shared the repo with staff)
    If there is no repository, create a new one and share it with course e-mail address: tisubjects@gmail.com so the staff can access your work.
        IMPORTANT: If the staff cannot access your repository and the relevant materials, those are considered as missing (even if there is something in)!
