Week-4 Exercise (1/3)

    Students are given a per-prepared .csv data file on automotive topic

    Create a new Jupyter notebook in Google Colabs

        Use Google Chrome browser while working with Google Colabs (issues may come up with Firefox)

    Share the link to your notebook in our Slack channel #rae473-course

    Train yourself with a given exercise using PANDAS (details on the next slide)



Week-4 Exercise:

    1 - Use the .csv file and assign it to a dataframe called cars --- OK

    2 - Print the number of rows in the dataset; --- OK

    3 - Print the name of all the columns --- OK 

    4 - Print only the records with cars of red color; --- OK

    5 - Select all the records where the year IS NOT "1992" --- OK

    6 - Select model, year and price columns for the cars  from the last 10 rows --- OK

    7 - Calculate statistical data for the price column as follows:

	    a - Select and print 5 lines from the beginning of a price column and 
	    calculate sum of the values, minimal value, maximal value, median

    	    b - Select and print 5 lines from the end of a price column and calculate sum 
    	    of the values, minimal value, maximal value, median

    * Apply to the data frame other methods and techniques you know on PANDAS 
    (or have learnt from offered training)
